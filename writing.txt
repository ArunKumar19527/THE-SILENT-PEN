*****************************THE SILENT PEN****************************

Spooky silence prevailed in the surrounding,darkness had engulfed the 
valley of riyade-e-zial that night,which like no other city had 
witnessed a history that only a few live to tell ,and a far fewer 
brave enough to listen to. light up the lighter and put some fire
you stupid, enraged over a stone he had stepped on ,he said to the
boy,a thin innocent boy.Is this place safe? said the boy ,well do you
think it is? You should see the beauty of nature,you are here for 
it,right?There is hardly any 'BEAUTY OF NATURE' here.



This is a better version of the story.
